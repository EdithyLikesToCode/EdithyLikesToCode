### 👨‍💻 **About Me**

Hi! I'm **EdithyMaster**. I'm a passionate developer specializing in **backend development** within the minecraft ecosystem.

My goal is to make minecraft as fun as possible by testing the limits of the Minecraft and Paper APIs!


### 🛠️ **What I Do**

*   ☕ **Core Logic:** Writing efficient Java plugins that handle complex server events.
*   🔌 **Plugin Integration:** Making different APIs talk to each other seamlessly.
*   🎨 **Game Design:** Designing unique gameplay mechanics such as custom world generation.
*   📋 **User Experience:** Everything I make is made with the end-user (the player) in mind.
*   📡 **Optimization:** I prioritize low-latency and stutter-free code to ensure a seamless experience for players.

### 📈 **Current Focus: 🌹 FLOWERION**

My upcoming project is more than just any minecraft server. it is a collection of custom-written systems and unique mechanics that make the game feel refreshing and new including:
1.  **Custom World Generation** 🌍
2.  **Custom Bosses & PVP Arenas** ⚔️
3.  **Daily in-game Events** 🌟
